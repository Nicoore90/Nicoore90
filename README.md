Hello!! I'm Nicolas, and I'm a fullstack developer currently located in CÃ³rdoba, Argentina.

I started studying web development in 2020, with the covid pandemic. I fell in love with it because I see the potential of satisfying certain needs for customers.

I am passionate about creating value for the companies and people who I work with.

I consider myself a highly methodic, goal oriented and organized person.

Down here you can see some of my projects. If you think I can be a good fit for your company, I highly encourage you to contact me at nicoaleore@gmail.com
